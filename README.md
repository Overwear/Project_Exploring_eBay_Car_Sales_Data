# Project_Exploring_ebay_Car_Sales_Data

## Skills Used
In this project I used python's pandas library to:
* read and load a csv data set into python
* show summary statisitcs (IQRs, min, max, mean, median)
* clean data columns by converting the data from text to it's respective data type (ex: price in text -> price in float)
* remove outlier data that skewed the dataset
* analyze aggregate columns to view relationships and patterns.
* created data series and data frames from subsets of the dataset
